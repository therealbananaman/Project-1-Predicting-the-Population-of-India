This first project was an exercise in linear regression using Python.

Step 1: Gathering Data
I started this project by aquiring the data on India's population on Kaggle. After trimming the data, I saved it as a CSV file in case I wanted to use Power BI to illustrate the data.

Step 2: Importing the necessary libraries
In this project I used pandas for data manipulation and scikit-learn for linear regression. As there is no need to use Power BI or Tableau in this project, I opted to use matplotlib to illustrate the data.

Step 3: Loading the data
I used AI to save time and write the data in an appropraite from to use on Python.

Step 4: Train the model
This is where scikit-learn was used to fir the model using linear regression.

Step 5: Discovering predictions
After running the program, the results are as follows:

Predicted population for 2025: 1456719081

Predicted population for 2030: 1536464202

Predicted population for 2035: 1616209323

Predicted population for 2040: 1695954444
